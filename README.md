Question 1: Recursion

This program shows how recursion works in C++.
It has two main functions.
The first function swaps characters in an array between two positions using recursive calls.
It keeps calling itself until both positions meet or cross.
The second function prints a number pattern using recursion.
It prints the same number multiple times and then calls itself again with a smaller value.
This question helps to understand how recursive functions work and how they stop using base cases.

Question 2: Singly Linked List

This program uses a singly linked list and object-oriented programming.
It has a base class called Feature and two derived classes called LandFeature and WaterFeature.
Each class shows a message when analyzed, using the concept of polymorphism.
The linked list stores these features and allows inserting, deleting, displaying, and reversing the list.
It shows how inheritance, virtual functions, and pointers are used together in a program.

Question 3: Doubly Linked List

This program creates a simple library system using a doubly linked list.
Each node stores a book’s ID, title, and author.
The user can add new books, delete books, and view the list from start to end or end to start.
The menu-driven system makes it easy to test all functions.
This question explains how both next and previous pointers work in a doubly linked list and how data can be moved in both directions.

Question 4: Queue

This program simulates a ticket booking queue.
Each customer has an ID, name, and number of tickets.
The queue works on the First In First Out rule, meaning the first customer to enter is served first.
The program allows adding new customers, serving the next customer, and showing all customers in the queue.
It teaches how to implement a queue using linked list concepts.

Question 5: Stacks

This program uses two types of stacks — one made with an array and another with a linked list.
Both stacks perform the same operations but store data differently.
The linked list stack uses nodes connected by pointers, while the array stack uses a resizable array.
These stacks are used to perform similar operations as the recursion question, showing how recursion can be replaced with stack logic.
This question explains how stacks work, how data is pushed and popped, and how both stack types handle memory differently.
